# Games for People with Phones and Friends

This game is a Jackbox-style multiplayer game where players can use a web client to create a party, and then join that party on their Android phones. When the web client presses play, the users must shake their phones as much as possible to "pop" their soda can. The first user to do so wins.

The reason that I like this project is because the team that I was a part of did a great job of setting up a very easily expandable mini-game suite. If we had more time for development and playtesting than this game would not only consist of the one can shaking game, but many other possible fun and silly phone games.   

## What was my role in this project?

My role in this project was to be the network programmer, doing things like setting up replication from the client to the server, creating the lobby room logic, and more.  

## Playing the Game

To play the game users must have a web client to host the game from the [Itch page](https://benjafriend.itch.io/gfppnf), and than download the Android app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PodSquad.GFPPNF). Enter the room code and you are ready to go!
